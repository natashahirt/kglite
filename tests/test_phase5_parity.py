"""Phase 5 crunch-point parity tests.

Guards the columnar-cleanup + per-backend-impls phase of the 0.8.0
storage refactor. Tests here:

- **enum-match audit** — confirms that `GraphBackend::<Variant>` match
  sites are confined to the documented whitelist (the dispatcher in
  `schema.rs`, the PyO3 boundary in `mod.rs`, the trait declarations in
  `storage/mod.rs`, and the three disk-internal boundary files
  `ntriples.rs`, `io_operations.rs`, `batch_operations.rs` which reach
  into `DiskGraph` internals for bulk-path performance).
- **graph.copy() CoW correctness** — mutating a copy leaves the
  original unchanged on every backend. This is the Phase 0 crunch-point
  re-asserted after Phase 5's per-backend impls + ColumnStore split.
- **binary-size regression gate** — the release `.dylib` stays under
  the +20% budget relative to the Phase 4 baseline.

Marker assignment is per-function so the structural gate runs in
default CI while the rest stay opt-in:

  - `test_enum_match_audit` — unmarked (pure file scan, < 1s).
  - `test_graph_copy_cow_correctness_*` — `@pytest.mark.parity`
    (functional, needs backend setup).
  - `test_binary_size_regression` — `@pytest.mark.binary_size`
    (needs the release `.dylib` built; CI's `python-tests` job
    already does `cargo build --release`, so it plugs in there).
  - `test_dead_code_check` — `@pytest.mark.parity` (runs
    `cargo clippy --release`, ~30s).

                      added when the first CI run on 0.9.52 surfaced

                      and 0.9.52 (~52% on macOS) is concentrated in:
                        * 14 tree-sitter grammars (Dart added 0.9.51,
                          Swift 0.9.40, PHP/HTML/CSS in the 0.9.2x
                          range — each grammar is ~0.5-1 MB);
                        * fastembed feature default-on for the
                          kglite-mcp-server binary build (ort runtime
                          + hf-hub native TLS path, ~3-4 MB);
                        * mcp-methods 0.3.x server-feature evolution;
                        * sodir / wikidata workspace crates with

                      The kglite-mcp-server *library* is now bundled

                      duplication — but pulls the server's own closure
                      (mcp-methods, rmcp, hyper/hyper-util, clap,
                        tracing-subscriber) into the cdylib: ~3 MB net on
                      macOS after strip, more on Linux (no strip).

                      One cause: the tree-sitter-julia grammar (16th
                      language). At 6,510,192 bytes of rlib it is the
                      largest grammar in the set — bigger than C# and
                      Swift — so it alone clears the +10% gate. Julia's
                      syntax is unusually broad (large operator table,
                      string/command macros, broadcast + `where`
                      forms). No engine growth is involved.
