# Common Recipes

Short, copy-paste examples for common tasks.

## Upsert with MERGE

```python
graph.cypher("""
    MERGE (p:Person {email: 'alice@example.com'})
    ON CREATE SET p.created = '2024-01-01', p.name = 'Alice'
    ON MATCH SET p.last_seen = '2024-01-15'
""")
```

## Top-K Nodes by Centrality

Two equivalent forms — pick by who's calling. Agent / manifest /
Cypher-tool contexts want the `CALL` form because everything reaches
KGLite through `cypher()` there:

```python
graph.cypher("""
    CALL pagerank() YIELD node, score
    RETURN node.title AS title, score
    ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10
""")
```

For Python-only callers, the inherent method is shorter and skips the
parser:

```python
top_nodes = graph.pagerank(top_k=10)
for node in top_nodes:
    print(f"{node['title']}: {node['score']:.3f}")
```

The same `CALL <algo>() YIELD ...` shape works for the other graph
algorithms — see {doc}`graph-algorithms` for the full list.

## 2-Hop Neighborhood

```python
graph.cypher("""
    MATCH (me:Person {name: 'Alice'})-[:KNOWS*2]-(fof:Person)
    WHERE fof <> me
    RETURN DISTINCT fof.name
""")
```

## Export Subgraph

```python
subgraph = graph.select("Person").where({"name": "Alice"}).expand(hops=2).to_subgraph()
subgraph.export("alice_network.graphml", format="graphml")
```

## Parameterized Queries

```python
graph.cypher(
    "MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.city = $city AND p.age > $min_age RETURN p.name", params={"city": "Oslo", "min_age": 25}
)
```

## Delete Subgraph

```python
graph.cypher("""
    MATCH (u:User) WHERE u.status = 'inactive'
    DETACH DELETE u
""")
```

## Aggregation with Relationship Properties

```python
graph.cypher("""
    MATCH (p:Person)-[r:RATED]->(m:Movie)
    RETURN p.name, avg(r.score) AS avg_rating, count(m) AS movies_rated
    ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
""")
```

## Replace Cypher `SET` aggregations with `add_properties()`

When you've been recomputing summary properties on parent nodes via
imperative Cypher `SET` after running an aggregation `MATCH`, the
fluent `add_properties()` API expresses the same operation
declaratively in a single chain. The hub-aggregation pattern (`count
of children`, `sum of a child property`, `most-recent timestamp`) is
the textbook fit.

### Cypher way — imperative `SET` per metric

```python
# Compute three aggregates on Field nodes from their child Wells:
# n_wells, total_production, max_depth.
graph.cypher("""
    MATCH (f:Field)-[:HAS_WELL]->(w:Well)
    WITH f, count(w) AS n_wells,
              sum(w.production) AS total_prod,
              max(w.depth) AS max_depth
    SET f.n_wells = n_wells,
        f.total_production = total_prod,
        f.deepest_well = max_depth
""")
```

This works but: each metric is a separate string; mistyping a
property name fails silently; the schema for the new properties
isn't visible to `g.describe()` until run; the call writes to the
graph in-place rather than yielding a re-queryable view.

### Fluent way — declarative `add_properties` with `Agg`

```python
from kglite import Agg

graph.select("Field").traverse("HAS_WELL").add_properties(
    {
        "Well": {
            "n_wells": Agg.count(),
            "total_production": Agg.sum("production"),
            "deepest_well": Agg.max("depth"),
        }
    }
)
```

Same effect on the graph. The metric definitions are typed
expressions (autocompletes in IDEs); the traversal direction is
explicit; you can chain further (`.collect()`, `.to_df()`) without
re-querying.

### Spatial hub aggregation

When the parent has geometry, mix `Spatial.*` helpers in:

```python
from kglite import Agg, Spatial

graph.select("Structure").compare("Well", "contains").add_properties(
    {
        "Structure": {
            "wells_inside": Agg.count(),
            "avg_well_depth": Agg.mean("depth"),
            "struct_area_m2": Spatial.area(),
            "mean_dist_to_centroid": Spatial.distance(),
        }
    }
)
```

The `compare('Well', 'contains')` step uses the spatial index, so
this is one query whether you have 1k wells or 1M.

### When to keep the Cypher form

`SET` is still the right tool when:

- The aggregation needs `WHERE` clauses on relationship properties
  that `add_properties()` doesn't expose (e.g. `WHERE r.score > 0.5`
  on the edge between parent and child).
- You're doing in-place mutation on properties that depend on
  other in-place mutations within the same query (multi-step `WITH`
  pipelines).
- The aggregation crosses three or more node types in non-hierarchy
  ways (e.g. both up- and down-walks from the same anchor).

Otherwise the fluent form is type-checkable, cheaper to read, and
re-runnable without re-querying.

### Helper reference

**`Agg`:** `count()`, `sum(prop)`, `mean(prop)`, `min(prop)`,
`max(prop)`, `std(prop)`, `collect(prop)`

**`Spatial`:** `distance()`, `area()`, `perimeter()`,
`centroid_lat()`, `centroid_lon()`

The raw string forms (`'count(*)'`, `'mean(depth)'`, `'distance'`,
etc.) still work — the helpers just return those strings, so mixing
is fine when adapting older code incrementally. See
[`docs/guides/traversal-hierarchy.md`](traversal-hierarchy.md) for
the full traversal-API context.
