KGLite is an embedded, Cypher-queryable knowledge graph for Python,
built so you can hand it to an LLM agent. `pip install kglite` and
point `kglite.code_tree.build(".")` at any source directory — your
first queryable graph in seconds. It ships with a bundled MCP server,
a `describe()` method that emits a system-prompt-shaped schema, and
structural validators that compose with Cypher.

> kglite is a **pure-Rust knowledge graph engine**
> ([`crates/kglite`](https://github.com/kkollsga/kglite/tree/main/crates/kglite))
> packaged for Python via `pip install kglite`. The Bolt-server and
> MCP-server binaries are sibling Rust crates wrapping the same
> engine. If you want kglite as a Rust library — without the Python
> wheel in your build — see **[Use from Rust](#use-from-rust)** below.

> ```
>
> `SEC.fetch` downloads the named forms for the named companies and

## Use cases

The same agent-facing surface works whether the graph holds legal
precedents, a Wikidata slice, a SQL warehouse, a RAG corpus, or a
parsed codebase.

- 🏦 **SEC EDGAR.** `SEC.fetch(path, forms, companies, years=2)`
  builds a US-public-company graph from the SEC's free data: insider
  transactions (Form 4), institutional holdings (13F), activist
  stakes (SC 13D), board composition (DEF 14A), 8-K events — with
  XBRL financials and Exhibit 21 subsidiaries via `SEC.open`. **→
  [SEC guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/sec.html).**
- 🏛️ **Domain knowledge for agents.** Legal precedents + citations,
  regulatory rules, medical ontologies, manufacturing BOMs, scientific
  catalogues — anything with structure becomes a queryable graph an
  MCP-capable agent can reason over. See the
  [legal-graph example](https://github.com/kkollsga/kglite/blob/main/examples/legal_graph.py)
  for a Norwegian-Supreme-Court walk-through (laws + decisions +
  citation edges + judge metadata).
- 📊 **Business data → queryable graph.** Any tabular source — SQL,
  CSV, Parquet, REST API responses, pandas DataFrames — goes straight
  in via `add_nodes(df, ...)` and `add_connections(df, ...)`. Layer a
  graph on top of your warehouse and the agent reasons over the
  relationships without you writing a server. **→
  [Data Loading guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/data-loading.html).**
- 🌐 **Public datasets.** `wikidata.open(path)` and `sodir.open(path)`
  handle the *fetch + build + cache* cycle. Mapped and disk storage
  query graphs that don't fit in RAM — a billion-edge Wikidata graph
  on a 16 GB laptop. **→ See [Bundled datasets](#bundled-datasets)
  below.**
- 📚 **RAG with structure.** Documents, chunks, entities, and the
  edges between them in one graph. Combine `text_score()` vector
  similarity with Cypher traversal — *"find court cases semantically
  similar to my fact pattern, then walk one hop to related
  precedents"* — hybrid retrieval in one query, no second vector DB.
  **→ [Semantic Search guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/semantic-search.html).**
- 📂 **Codebase analysis.** `kglite.code_tree.build(".")` parses 13
  languages into Function / Class / Module / Route nodes with
  web-framework route detection (Flask, FastAPI, Django). See the
  [notebook above](https://github.com/kkollsga/kglite/blob/main/examples/codebase_to_claude_mcp.ipynb)
  for the full code → Claude Desktop workflow. **→
  [Code analysis guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/code-tree.html).**
- 🧠 **Markdown knowledge bases & agent memory.** `kglite.okf.build(dir)`
  ingests an [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog)
  bundle — or a Claude memory dir, skills folder, or Obsidian vault — into a
  graph: frontmatter → node properties, markdown links → typed edges. Then
  cluster it (`CALL leiden`), find orphaned or stale notes, and surface dangling
  references — the query engine OKF itself doesn't ship. **→
  [OKF guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/okf.html).**

## Why Cypher?

Questions over connected data — *which insiders sold this stock, who
sits on two boards, what cites this case* — are pattern matches. In
SQL they become multi-table joins; in Cypher the pattern is the
query:

```cypher
-- Insider sells, most recent first
MATCH (t:InsiderTransaction {direction: 'sale'})-[:BY_INSIDER]->(p:Person)
MATCH (t)-[:IN_COMPANY]->(c:Company)
RETURN p.title, c.title, t.shares, t.price_per_share
ORDER BY t.transaction_date DESC LIMIT 10
```

Cypher pays off most when the data has real structure and your
questions traverse it.

**Pick KGLite** when you want Cypher + Python ergonomics + LLM-agent
plumbing in one wheel. **Pick Kuzu** if your workload is heavy
analytical OLAP and you can accept that the project is no longer
maintained (archived 2025). **Pick NetworkX** when you need its
enormous graph-algorithm library and your data fits in RAM. **Pick
rustworkx** when you want NetworkX's API in Rust with no query
language. **Pick Neo4j Embedded** when you've standardised on
server-mode Cypher and want the in-process driver for tests.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Python (the headline distribution path)
pip install kglite

# Optional extras
pip install 'kglite[embed]'      # fastembed + onnxruntime for text_score()
pip install 'kglite[neo4j]'      # Neo4j Python driver for Bolt-server tests
```

```python
import pandas as pd
import kglite

# Three storage modes — pick by graph size:
#   default (in-memory)   — small/medium graphs, fastest queries
#   storage="mapped"      — mmap columns, RAM-friendly as you grow
#   storage="disk", path=…  — 100M+ nodes, Wikidata-scale, loaded lazily
graph = kglite.KnowledgeGraph()

# Bulk-load nodes from a DataFrame.
people = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "id": ["alice", "bob", "eve"],
        "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"],
        "age": [28, 35, 41],
        "city": ["Oslo", "Bergen", "Trondheim"],
    }
)
graph.add_nodes(people, node_type="Person", unique_id_field="id", node_title_field="name")

# Bulk-load relationships the same way.
knows = pd.DataFrame({"src": ["alice", "bob"], "tgt": ["bob", "eve"]})
graph.add_connections(
    knows,
    connection_type="KNOWS",
    source_type="Person",
    source_id_field="src",
    target_type="Person",
    target_id_field="tgt",
)

# Query — returns a ResultView (lazy; data stays in Rust until accessed).
for row in graph.cypher("""
    MATCH (p:Person) WHERE p.age > 30
    RETURN p.name AS name, p.city AS city
    ORDER BY p.age DESC
"""):
    print(row["name"], row["city"])

# Or get a pandas DataFrame directly.
df = graph.cypher("MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name, p.age ORDER BY p.age", to_df=True)

# Persist to disk and reload.
graph.save("my_graph.kgl")
loaded = kglite.load("my_graph.kgl")
```

## Serve it to an agent

Three levels of effort, three levels of capability.

### 1. One command — any `.kgl` becomes an MCP server

```bash
kglite-mcp-server --graph path/to/graph.kgl
```

The server exposes `cypher_query`, `graph_overview`, schema
introspection, structural validators, and source-file tools over MCP
stdio. Drop it into Claude Desktop / Cursor / any MCP-capable client
and your graph is queryable. Works on every graph kglite can build —
your own, Wikidata, Sodir, code-tree.

### 2. Customise with a YAML manifest

Drop `<basename>_mcp.yaml` next to the graph (e.g. `wikidata_mcp.yaml`
beside `wikidata.kgl`) and the server auto-loads it at boot.

```yaml
name: Wikidata Explorer
source_root: /path/to/related/source        # exposes read/grep/list
extensions:
  embedder: { kind: fastembed, model: bge-small }   # enables text_score()
  csv_http_server: true                              # bulk CSV exports
tools:                                               # inline parameterised Cypher
  - name: who_invented
    cypher: |
      MATCH (i:Q5)-[:P61]->(t {label:$thing})
      RETURN i.label LIMIT 5
```

No fork required for most customisation. **→
[MCP server guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/mcp-servers.html).**

### 3. Teach the agent with bundled skills

Markdown skill files (`<basename>.skills/*.md`) ship methodology for
each tool. The agent reads `cypher_query.md` at session start to learn
your schema conventions, `read_code_source.md` to know when to drill
into source vs. query the graph, etc. Three layers compose:
kglite-bundled defaults + your project's `.skills/` overrides +
operator-declared domain packs. Skills with `applies_when:` predicates
only activate when the graph contains the relevant node types — so a
non-code graph never sees `read_code_source` methodology.

Net effect: the agent comes pre-loaded with how to use your graph,
rather than discovering it through trial-and-error. **→
[AI Agents guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/ai-agents.html).**

## Bundled datasets

Three wrappers turn well-known public sources into queryable graphs
without writing a loader. Each handles the *fetch + build + cache*
cycle, returns a `KnowledgeGraph` you can `cypher()` against, and
respects a per-dataset cooldown so re-running just reloads the cached
graph in seconds. KGLite is independent of the upstream
organisations — see each module docstring for non-affiliation notes.
**→ [Datasets guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/datasets.html).**

### SEC EDGAR

US-public-company knowledge graph from the SEC's free public data —
all 14M historical filings + per-filing payload parsing for Form 4
(insider transactions), 13F-HR (institutional holdings), SC 13D
(activist stakes), DEF 14A (board composition), XBRL company facts
(financial metrics), 10-K Exhibit 21 (subsidiaries), 8-K cover pages
(material event Item codes):

```python
from kglite.datasets.sec import SEC

# SEC.fetch — name the forms, the companies, a span; get a graph back.
g = SEC.fetch("/data/sec", ["4", "8-K", "DEF 14A"], ["AAPL", "TSLA"], years=2, user_agent="Your Name your@email.com")

# SEC.open — full control: separate filing-index vs. payload spans,
# storage mode, and the include_* flags (XBRL financials, Exhibit 21
# subsidiaries).
g = SEC.open("/data/sec", years=10, detailed=2, user_agent="Your Name your@email.com")

# Full universe — drop `companies`; auto-escalates to mode="disk".
g = SEC.open("/data/sec", years="all", detailed=5, user_agent="Your Name your@email.com")
```

Two dozen-plus typed node types — Company, Person, Filing,
InsiderTransaction, Holding, InstitutionalHolding, CorporateEvent,
Compensation, Role, MetricFact, Subsidiary and more — wired by typed
edges, every fact node tracing back to its source filing. Three-tier
`raw` / `processed` / `graph/{mode}` cache
— `raw` is immutable, `processed` regenerates only when its `raw`
source changes, `graph/{mode}/` reuses on reopen unless
`force_rebuild=True`. SEC's 10 req/s fair-access policy is enforced
by an internal token-bucket rate limiter; the `user_agent` arg is
mandatory (SEC returns 403 without it).

Source data is public domain (US Govt work) — redistribute the built
`.kgl` however you like. **→
[SEC guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/sec.html).**

### Wikidata

Single-stream `latest-truthy.nt.bz2` from
[dumps.wikimedia.org](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/) —
parallel-decoded with a bit-level block scanner, parsed, built into a
queryable graph in one call:

```python
from kglite.datasets import wikidata

g = wikidata.open("/data/wd")  # full graph
g = wikidata.open("/data/wd", entity_limit_millions=100)  # 100M slice
g = wikidata.open(
    "/data/wd",
    storage="memory",  # in-memory, fast tests
    entity_limit_millions=10,
)
```

### Sodir (Norwegian Offshore Directorate)

Petroleum-domain example dataset — `sodir.open("/data/sodir")` returns
a queryable graph of fields, wellbores, discoveries, licences,
stratigraphy and 28 more node types from the public ArcGIS REST
FeatureServer at [factmaps.sodir.no](https://factmaps.sodir.no/api/rest/services/DataService).
Built in ~30 s on first run, cached after. Useful as a worked example
of `complement_blueprint` (extend a baseline schema without touching
the canonical types) — **→ [Datasets guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/datasets.html).**

## Recipes

Short patterns for the most-common shapes. Each is self-contained.

### Hybrid semantic + structural retrieval

Combine vector similarity (`text_score()`) with Cypher pattern
matching in one query:

```python
graph.cypher(
    """
    MATCH (c:Chunk)-[:IN_DOC]->(d:Document)
    RETURN c.text, d.title,
           text_score(c.embedding, $query_vec) AS score
    ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 5
""",
    params={"query_vec": query_embedding},
)
```

Vector embeddings via `pip install 'kglite[embed]'` (adds fastembed +
onnxruntime). **→ [Semantic Search guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/semantic-search.html).**

### Structural validators — surface data-integrity gaps

Fourteen built-in `CALL` procedures find the gaps that aren't visible
from normal queries: orphan nodes, missing-required-edge violations,
two-step cycles, duplicate titles, parallel edges, cardinality
violations, more. They compose with the rest of Cypher.

```python
# Wellbores in our sodir graph that lack a production licence
graph.cypher("""
    CALL missing_required_edge({type: 'Wellbore', edge: 'IN_LICENCE'}) YIELD node
    RETURN node.id, node.title
""")
```

`missing_required_edge` and `missing_inbound_edge` validate the
`(type, edge)` direction against the graph's actual schema and refuse
to execute when misused. **→ Full procedure list in the
[Cypher reference](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/cypher.html#structural-validator-call-procedures).**

### Graph algorithms

Shortest path (BFS or Dijkstra), centrality, community detection,
clustering — all in Cypher:

```python
graph.cypher("""
    MATCH path = shortestPath((a:User {name:'Alice'})-[*]-(b:User {name:'Eve'}))
    RETURN path
""")
```

[Recipes index](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/guides/recipes.html).**

## Use from Rust

The same engine is available as a pure-Rust crate — embed it in a
Rust binary without the Python wheel in your build:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
kglite = "0.10"
```

```rust
use kglite::api::{load_file, session, Value};
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let graph = load_file("my_graph.kgl")?;     // same .kgl as Python writes
    let params = HashMap::new();
    let opts = session::ExecuteOptions {
        params: &params, deadline: None, max_rows: None,
        lazy_eligible: false, disabled_passes: None, embedder: None,
    };
    let outcome = session::execute_read(
        &graph,
        "MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name LIMIT 5",
        &opts,
    )?;
    for row in &outcome.result.rows {
        if let Some(Value::String(name)) = row.first() {
            println!("{}", name);
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Zero PyO3 in the dependency tree:
`cargo tree -p your-crate | grep pyo3` → empty.

The Bolt server (`crates/kglite-bolt-server`) and the Rust MCP

[Operators guide](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/bolt-server.html)
for deployment.

For **non-Rust language bindings** (Go via cgo, JavaScript via napi,
JVM via JNI, .NET via P/Invoke), the
[`crates/kglite-c`](https://github.com/kkollsga/kglite/tree/main/crates/kglite-c)
crate exposes the engine through a stable C ABI — 30 `extern "C"`
functions covering lifecycle / Cypher / datasets / embedder, plus a
cbindgen-generated `kglite.h`. See
[`docs/rust/c-abi.md`](https://kglite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rust/c-abi.html)
for the design and

  — declarative CSV→graph loading via a JSON blueprint; lat/lon
  coordinates and pipeline-path traversal queries.
- **[`crates/kglite-mcp-server/`](https://github.com/kkollsga/kglite/tree/main/crates/kglite-mcp-server)**
  — Rust-native single-binary MCP server (built on rmcp + the
  [mcp-methods] framework). Reach for it when the manifest doesn't
  express what you need; the binary is the reference for layering
  domain-specific tools on top of the generic surface.

## Benchmarks

KGLite builds and queries Wikidata-scale graphs on a laptop. Measured
with [`benchmarks/wiki_benchmark.py`](https://github.com/kkollsga/kglite/blob/main/benchmarks/wiki_benchmark.py)
on an M-series MacBook.

**Ingest** — full pipeline from compressed N-Triples to a queryable graph:

| dataset   | triples | nodes  | edges  | ingest  | throughput       | peak RAM |
|-----------|--------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|------------------|---------:|
| wiki100m  |  100 M  |  938 K |  748 K |   29 s  | 3.4 M triples/s  |  1.3 GB  |
| wiki500m  |  500 M  |  5.6 M |  6.7 M |  157 s  | 3.2 M triples/s  |  5.2 GB  |
| wiki1000m |    1 B  | 14.7 M | 15.4 M |  395 s  | 2.5 M triples/s  |  7.0 GB  |

Reloading a saved 1 B-triple graph from disk (7 GB on-disk): **3.5 s**.

**Query latency on the 1 B-triple graph** (mapped storage):

| Cypher                                                              |     wall |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------:|
| `MATCH (n)-[:P31]->(:human) RETURN count(n)` — typed aggregation    |   0.5 ms |
| `MATCH (a)-[:P31]->(b)-[:P279]->(c) LIMIT 10` — 2-hop typed         |   0.9 ms |
| `MATCH (a)-[:P31]->(b {nid:'Q64'}) RETURN a LIMIT 20` — pivot       |     1 ms |
| `MATCH (a)-[:P31]->(:human)` `MATCH (a)-[:P27]->(c) LIMIT 10` — join |   44 ms |

Disk and mapped storage build at the same speed; mapped wins on
small-result queries (in-memory inverted index), disk wins on
unbounded typed traversals (sorted-CSR mmap I/O). No server, no
tuning, same Python process as your code.

## Requirements

Python 3.10+ (CPython) | macOS (ARM), Linux (x86_64/aarch64), Windows (x86_64) | `pandas >= 1.5`

## Stability

KGLite is `v0.10.x` (Beta), versioned under [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
The Python API surface and the supported Cypher dialect have been
largely stable across the `0.9` → `0.10` line; the occasional breaking
change (e.g. the `0.10.10` node-id semantics unification) is called out
prominently in the changelog. The Beta label reflects API maturity, not
engine reliability — the storage and query engine are covered by parity
oracles and a differential Cypher corpus on every change. Deprecations
and breaking changes are announced in
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/kkollsga/kglite/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
